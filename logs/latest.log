[00:38:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cloddity> ye same :blobsweat:
[00:38:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cloddity> the iron farm is the most important
[00:39:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cloddity> but u can get away with a much simpler design
[00:39:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <UswordM> yea when u guys finish that
[00:39:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <UswordM> will be chilling
[00:39:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cloddity> yee

[00:40:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cloddity> the rest is just water powered
[00:40:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <UswordM> dang
[00:41:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <UswordM> need to try to build an iron farm on my bros server once we get setup
[00:41:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cloddity> gud idea
[00:41:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cloddity> iron farm actually op :blobsweat:
[00:41:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <UswordM> yea :blobsweat:
[00:41:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cloddity> the simplest iron farm needs only three villagers
[00:42:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cloddity> but it still produces a rly gud amount
[00:42:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <UswordM> :HuTaoThink:
[00:42:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <UswordM> very nice
[00:43:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <UswordM> kinda wan try a complex design but depends on how much time I have to build it then
[00:43:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <UswordM> :kleeBOOM:
[00:43:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cloddity> complex design's not too bad
[00:43:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <Cloddity> the logic is the same as the simple ones
